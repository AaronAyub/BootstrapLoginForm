# UserPanel

A simple login and registration form made to demonstrate PHP and MySQL. Javascript, CSS, and the Bootstrap 5 framework are used here. 

This website relies on a MySQL to host a database of users. To test this out, SQL must be running, with a username and password entered for an SQL user with permission to create, select, and insert to databases.
